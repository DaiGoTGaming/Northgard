				<61 id="wyv_known_small_wyvern2Stag" who="Brand">
					<text>Indeed. We would lose fewer men and women than against the bigger one.</text>
				</61>
				<62 id="wyv_known_small_wyvern2Goat" who="Halvard">

					<text>Yeah, but it's less fun, too. The bigger bugger was more... bitey.</text>
				</63>
				<64 id="wyv_known_small_wyvern2Raven" who="Liv">
					<text>It still looks pretty nasty. But if we REALLY must slay things to show off, it might be a better choice than the huge, nightmare-fueling one.</text>

				<65 id="wyv_known_small_wyvern2Boar" who="Svarn">
					<text>It is indeed less dangerous than the bigger variety... but make no mistake, it is still a very tough creature.</text>

					<text>By Odin's missing eye! Is this a wyvern? My father boasted of fighting one, but this thing is bigger than a longship!</text>

					<text>It looks fearsome, indeed. We certainly should not expect this battle to be easily won, if winnable at all.</text>
				</67>
				<68 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern2Goat" who="Halvard">
					<text>Attacking such a beast would be madness, young lord! I beg you not to give in to hubris. My people are tough survivors, but ordering them to face this monster would be tantamount to murder.</text>
				</68>
				<69 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern2Wolf" who="Egil">
					<text>Whoa, I might actually be experiencing fear for the first time ever. Nah, just kidding. I'm not sure my axes can even put a dent in its scales, though. Only one way to find out!</text>
				</69>
				<70 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern2Raven" who="Liv">
					<text>Well, this is absurd. Throwing warriors at this creature would be a needless waste of human life. On the other hand–and I can hardly believe I'm considering it–slaying it would give us a definite edge in the contest...</text>
				</70>
				<71 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern2Boar" who="Svarn">
					<text>I have seen wyverns, but never this big. I foresee many lives being wiped out if you decide to fight it, although... it would most certainly be the stuff of legends.</text>
				</71>
				<72 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern3Stag" who="Rig">
					<text>Agreed. At any rate, it would require more than a few warriors to bring it down. I will have to carefully consider this.</text>

					<text>You may just be right, Halvard. Yet somehow I feel we are up to the task... if we prepare carefully beforehand, that is.</text>
				</73>
				<74 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern3Wolf" who="Rig">
					<text>I know your warriors are ready to die just for a chance to fight such a unique beast. We will probably have to send in quite a few of them, though.</text>
				</74>
				<75 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern3Raven" who="Rig">
					<text>'Tis quite a gamble, indeed. We stand to lose many in the fight, but should we succeed... At any rate, we shall have to plan ahead carefully.</text>
				</75>
				<76 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern3Boar" who="Rig">
					<text>Many lives would be lost, 'tis true. On the other hand, if Borgild's people manage to bring it down, we might be done for. I will have to think it over.</text>
				</76>
				<77 id="wyv_known_big_wyvern1" who="Rig">
					<text>Another wyvern! Hmm, this one is a good deal bigger than the one we saw earlier. It is bound to make more damage.</text>
				</77>
				<78 id="wyv_known_big_wyvern2Stag" who="Brand">
					<text>It does look mightier. We should not take this beast lightly. In all likelihood, we shall have to draw even more warriors into the fight.</text>
				</78>
				<79 id="wyv_known_big_wyvern2Goat" who="Halvard">
					<text>The "small" one looked bad enough. I dread to imagine what will happen if we disturb this one's slumber.</text>
				</79>
				<80 id="wyv_known_big_wyvern2Wolf" who="Egil">
					<text>Yeah, it looks bigger and badder. I wonder if my axes can even make a dent in its scales. Let's find out!</text>
				</80>
				<81 id="wyv_known_big_wyvern2Raven" who="Liv">
					<text>From a purely rational point of view, it represents even more risk, but for a similar reward. Of course, not killing it would be a missed opportunity entirely. But is it worth the extra danger?</text>
				</81>
				<82 id="wyv_known_big_wyvern2Boar" who="Svarn">

					<text>I say we slay 'em and take their land! That oughta show Borgild what we're made of! Sure, we could trade food with them and make them our allies... but that'd be boring.</text>
				</86>
				<87 id="giant2Raven" who="Liv">
					<text>There are two ways we could gain fame from them: either defeat them and claim their land, or trade food with them until we've befriended them. Both are economically viable options. Decisions, decisions...</text>
				</87>
				<88 id="giant2Boar" who="Svarn">
					<text>We can either... collaborate with them through trade or... eradicate them and claim their land. Jotnär are powerful allies, but it will be costly. On the other hand, they are mighty foes...</text>
				</88>
				<89 id="giant3" who="Rig">
					<text>Earning their trust would take a while and cost a lot of food, but we would gain a powerful ally to accomplish other glorious deeds. Slaying them would be swifter but more dangerous and less rewarding. I need to ponder both options.</text>

			<name>Borgild</name>
			<desc>Brave and arrogant, the bannermaiden of the Bear Clan is a tough woman who bows to no one and shows little mercy for the weakhearted. She refused to recognize you as the rightful king since you lost the Regal Horn, and so she challenged you to a contest, from which you emerged victorious. She had no choice but to grudgingly pledge her allegiance.</desc>
