						<line2>
							<text>My father had gathered all his Jarls to make an announcement of the utmost importance.</text>
						</line2>
						<line3>
							<text>We were to embark for the wondrous lands of Northgard; riches, conquest and glory awaited us on this mysterious new continent.</text>
						</line3>

							<text>But the Norns had other plans for us...</text>
						</line4>
						<line5>
							<text>Dozens of armed men suddenly poured into the Hall and put an abrupt end to our ambitions... and to our lives.</text>
						</line5>
						<line6>
							<text>They were mercenaries led by a man named Hagen, from the Clan of the Raven.</text>
						</line6>
						<line7>
							<text>In a matter of minutes, we were all slaughtered like sheep.</text>
						</line7>
						<line8>
							<text>All... but me. Barely conscious and vastly outnumbered, I had no way to fight back, so I feigned death.</text>
						</line8>
						<line9>
							<text>I seethed as he stole the map of Northgard and ripped the Regal Horn from my father's throne, a family heirloom and the very symbol of our royalty.</text>
						</line9>
						<line10>
							<text>I had to avenge my father... and reclaim my kinghood!</text>

							<text>Speaking of which, there will be no shortage of mouths to feed, so let us seek out food. Wood is also a vital resource, being used for both heating and construction.</text>

							<text>With a serene face betraying no inner turmoil, Svarn, the rebel Boar leader, detailed Hvedrung's plan, although I could feel something boiling deep within him.</text>

							<text>The tyrant intended to destroy Bifrost, the legendary bridge to Asgard, for reasons unknown. But this would bring about Ragnarök, the end of the gods... and of our time. Svarn's rebellion existed solely to prevent this.</text>

							<text>Bifrost lay hidden, somewhere deep within Northgard. Svarn hoped to learn more by deciphering the gigantic Runestone of Asgard, an ancient frieze said to have been engraved by Odin himself.</text>

							<text>Bergelmir divided the land in two–the land you now call Jötunnheim. The sword was never intended as a symbol of division, but rather of sharing: the land... pain... joys. He wanted his sons to live AND work together.</text>

							<text>Slaying such a fiend would be worthy of a skald's song. It will not go down easily, though, so make sure you send enough warriors.</text>

							<text>'Tis the most terrifying thing I have seen in my days. And believe me, young lord, I have witnessed a great deal. Many men and women will likely die fighting this beast, if you so command it.</text>

							<text>By Fenrir, I'm shaking with excitement! How hard can it be to kill? Let's find out! I've got a spot for its head above my fireplace!</text>
						</line56>
						<line57 id="wyv_unknown_small_wyvern2Raven" who="BannerRaven">
							<text>That looks... dangerous. I can see why we would risk our lives fighting it, but is it really worth it?</text>
						</line57>
						<line58 id="wyv_unknown_small_wyvern2Boar" who="BannerBoar">
							<text>Wyverns are... mighty foes. We usually respect them and leave them be, although killing it would surely impress the she-bear.</text>
						</line58>
						<line59 id="wyv_unknown_small_wyvern3" who="BannerPlayer">
							<text>It certainly won't go down without a fight. Warriors, brace yourselves!</text>

							<text>Another wyvern! Hmm, this one looks less intimidating than what we encountered earlier. It should be easier to defeat.</text>
						</line60>
						<line61 id="wyv_known_small_wyvern2Stag" who="BannerStag">
							<text>Indeed. We would lose fewer men and women than against the bigger one.</text>
						</line61>
						<line62 id="wyv_known_small_wyvern2Goat" who="BannerGoat">
							<text>It still looks like a formidable opponent. We should not underestimate it.</text>
						</line62>
						<line63 id="wyv_known_small_wyvern2Wolf" who="BannerWolf">
							<text>Yeah, but it's less fun, too. The bigger bugger was more... bitey.</text>
						</line63>
						<line64 id="wyv_known_small_wyvern2Raven" who="BannerRaven">
							<text>It still looks pretty nasty. But if we REALLY must slay things to show off, it might be a better choice than the huge, nightmare-fueling one.</text>
						</line64>
						<line65 id="wyv_known_small_wyvern2Boar" who="BannerBoar">
							<text>It is indeed less dangerous than the bigger variety... but make no mistake, it is still a very tough creature.</text>
						</line65>
						<line66 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern1" who="BannerPlayer">
							<text>By Odin's missing eye! Is this a wyvern? My father boasted of fighting one, but this thing is bigger than a longship!</text>
						</line66>
						<line67 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern2Stag" who="BannerStag">
							<text>It looks fearsome, indeed. We certainly should not expect this battle to be easily won, if winnable at all.</text>
						</line67>
						<line68 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern2Goat" who="BannerGoat">
							<text>Attacking such a beast would be madness, young lord! I beg you not to give in to hubris. My people are tough survivors, but ordering them to face this monster would be tantamount to murder.</text>
						</line68>
						<line69 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern2Wolf" who="BannerWolf">
							<text>Whoa, I might actually be experiencing fear for the first time ever. Nah, just kidding. I'm not sure my axes can even put a dent in its scales, though. Only one way to find out!</text>
						</line69>
						<line70 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern2Raven" who="BannerRaven">
							<text>Well, this is absurd. Throwing warriors at this creature would be a needless waste of human life. On the other hand–and I can hardly believe I'm considering it–slaying it would give us a definite edge in the contest...</text>
						</line70>
						<line71 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern2Boar" who="BannerBoar">
							<text>I have seen wyverns, but never this big. I foresee many lives being wiped out if you decide to fight it, although... it would most certainly be the stuff of legends.</text>
						</line71>
						<line72 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern3Stag" who="BannerPlayer">
							<text>Agreed. At any rate, it would require more than a few warriors to bring it down. I will have to carefully consider this.</text>
						</line72>
						<line73 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern3Goat" who="BannerPlayer">
							<text>You may just be right, Halvard. Yet somehow I feel we are up to the task... if we prepare carefully beforehand, that is.</text>
						</line73>
						<line74 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern3Wolf" who="BannerPlayer">
							<text>I know your warriors are ready to die just for a chance to fight such a unique beast. We will probably have to send in quite a few of them, though.</text>
						</line74>
						<line75 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern3Raven" who="BannerPlayer">
							<text>'Tis quite a gamble, indeed. We stand to lose many in the fight, but should we succeed... At any rate, we shall have to plan ahead carefully.</text>
						</line75>
						<line76 id="wyv_unknown_big_wyvern3Boar" who="BannerPlayer">
							<text>Many lives would be lost, 'tis true. On the other hand, if Borgild's people manage to bring it down, we might be done for. I will have to think it over.</text>
						</line76>
						<line77 id="wyv_known_big_wyvern1" who="BannerPlayer">
							<text>Another wyvern! Hmm, this one is a good deal bigger than the one we saw earlier. It is bound to make more damage.</text>
						</line77>
						<line78 id="wyv_known_big_wyvern2Stag" who="BannerStag">
							<text>It does look mightier. We should not take this beast lightly. In all likelihood, we shall have to draw even more warriors into the fight.</text>
						</line78>
						<line79 id="wyv_known_big_wyvern2Goat" who="BannerGoat">
							<text>The "small" one looked bad enough. I dread to imagine what will happen if we disturb this one's slumber.</text>
						</line79>
						<line80 id="wyv_known_big_wyvern2Wolf" who="BannerWolf">
							<text>Yeah, it looks bigger and badder. I wonder if my axes can even make a dent in its scales. Let's find out!</text>
						</line80>
						<line81 id="wyv_known_big_wyvern2Raven" who="BannerRaven">
							<text>From a purely rational point of view, it represents even more risk, but for a similar reward. Of course, not killing it would be a missed opportunity entirely. But is it worth the extra danger?</text>
						</line81>
						<line82 id="wyv_known_big_wyvern2Boar" who="BannerBoar">
							<text>The lesser wyverns are certainly mighty beasts, but they are nothing compared to the greater variety.</text>

							<text>If we trade food with them, they become our allies and we gain fame. Of course, we could also slay them and claim their land, but is peace not preferable to war?</text>

							<text>I say we slay 'em and take their land! That oughta show Borgild what we're made of! Sure, we could trade food with them and make them our allies... but that'd be boring.</text>
						</line86>
						<line87 id="giant2Raven" who="BannerRaven">
							<text>There are two ways we could gain fame from them: either defeat them and claim their land, or trade food with them until we've befriended them. Both are economically viable options. Decisions, decisions...</text>
						</line87>
						<line88 id="giant2Boar" who="BannerBoar">
							<text>We can either... collaborate with them through trade or... eradicate them and claim their land. Jotnär are powerful allies, but it will be costly. On the other hand, they are mighty foes...</text>
						</line88>
						<line89 id="giant3" who="BannerPlayer">
							<text>Earning their trust would take a while and cost a lot of food, but we would gain a powerful ally to accomplish other glorious deeds. Slaying them would be swifter but more dangerous and less rewarding. I need to ponder both options.</text>

							<text>The fight against Hvedrung had brought the six clans of Northgard together in a strong alliance.</text>
						</line0>
						<line1>
							<text>But it did not suffice to prevent the onset of Ragnarök.</text>
						</line1>
						<line2>
							<text>Following the fateful day that Bifröst was damaged, an eternal night shrouded our land and many gates of fire and stone opened up all over Northgard.</text>
						</line2>
						<line3>
							<text>Through these doors, the sons of Muspell continued their assault across Northgard. We were forced to split up in order to repel them.</text>
						</line3>
						<line4>
							<text>In the midst of this ordeal, the separation of our clans was the danger I dreaded most.</text>
						</line4>
						<line5>
							<text>Faith in a king who failed to preserve Northgard was wavering. With no more hope to spare, our alliance had become fragile.</text>
						</line5>
						<line6>
							<text>I had to reunite the clans if I wanted this kingdom to survive.</text>
